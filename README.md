This repository contains an implementation of feature scaling in linear regression using Python.

## Overview

In this exercise, you'll revisit the same dataset as before and see how scaling the features changes which features are favored in a regularization step. The only thing different for this quiz compared to the previous one is the addition of a new step after loading the data, where you will use sklearn's StandardScaler(opens in a new tab) to standardize the data before you fit a linear regression model to the data with L1 (Lasso) regularization.

## Requirements

To run the code in the Jupyter Notebook, you need to have Python installed on your system along with the following libraries:

- NumPy
- pandas
- scikit-learn
- matplotlib

You can install these libraries using pip:

```bash
pip install numpy pandas scikit-learn matplotlib

```

## Usage

1. Clone this repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/BaraSedih11/Feature-Scaling.git
```

2. Navigate to the repository directory:

```bash
cd Feature Scaling
```

3. Open and run the Jupyter Notebook `Feature Scaling.ipynb` using Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab.

4. Follow along with the code and comments in the notebook to understand how polynomial regression is implemented using Python.
